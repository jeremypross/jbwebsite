            "The 2018 Lifetime Achievement Award Winner and slate of Inductees to the Hall of Fame is stellar, and we are proud to include them," G. Robert Bishop, Chairman of the Induction Committee. For more than 50 years, the IPHF has been and remains the only organization worldwide that recognizes and honors significant contributors to the artistic craft and science of photography. The 2018 cohort of awardees and inductees join 88 other artists and innovators, including: Steve Jobs, Annie Leibovitz, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams.

            Bernstein’s many album covers are listed among the most influential in rock music’s visual history. His first, at age 18, was Neil Young’s After the Gold Rush. Bernstein’s work is well-known in the world of music and is included in the permanent collection of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. His work has been published in a wide spectrum of books on music, musicians, and the music industry, as well as in The New York Times, Time, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair. In the past decade, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen each chose Joel’s photographs to be included in film, video and book projects documenting their careers.
