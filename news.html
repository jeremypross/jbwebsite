          <h3>Joel gets Lifetime Achievement Award from IPHF</h3>
          <h5><strong><i>October 17th, 2018</i></strong></h5>
          <p>
            Joel Bernstein is an acclaimed photographer whose work, spanning more than four decades, chronicles the inner lives and public moments of some of the most important performers our time. They include Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Prince, Jackson Browne, Tom Petty, and many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The 2018 Lifetime Achievement Award Winner and slate of Inductees to the Hall of Fame is stellar, and we are proud to include them," G. Robert Bishop, Chairman of the Induction Committee. For more than 50 years, the IPHF has been and remains the only organization worldwide that recognizes and honors significant contributors to the artistic craft and science of photography. The 2018 cohort of awardees and inductees join 88 other artists and innovators, including: Steve Jobs, Annie Leibovitz, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bernstein’s many album covers are listed among the most influential in rock music’s visual history. His first, at age 18, was Neil Young’s After the Gold Rush. Bernstein’s work is well-known in the world of music and is included in the permanent collection of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. His work has been published in a wide spectrum of books on music, musicians, and the music industry, as well as in The New York Times, Time, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair. In the past decade, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen each chose Joel’s photographs to be included in film, video and book projects documenting their careers.

          <h3>Joel To Receive 2018 Lifetime Achievement Aware from International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum</h3>
          <h5><strong><i>August 16th, 2018</i></strong></h5>
          <p>
            "The diversity of work and offerings from this year's awardees provides for a full range of fabulous photography. We are proud to bring them into the Hall of Fame," said Richard Miles, Chairman of the Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A nominating committee of IPHF representatives and notable photographic leaders with a passion for preserving and honoring the art of photography selected the inductees. To be eligible for induction, nominees were considered based on the noteworthy contributions they made to the art or science of photography that had a significant impact on the photography industry and/or history of photography. The inductees, though widely differing in style and practice, are individually seen as significant innovators in their respective fields. They are all risk takers who introduced the world to new means of artistic representation and expression.
